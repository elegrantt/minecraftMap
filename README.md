# My Minecraft Map
My Minecraft Map that I created in 1.8 before exporting to Vanilla 1.21.5. I will probably never update this map again, but your Minecraft should automatically update the map's game version.

## Instructions to play
1. Go to releases and download the latest one
2. Open your "saves" folder in your local ".minecraft" folder. In Linux, this would be /home/username/.minecraft/saves (same on MacOS), while on Windows it is in %appdata%/.minecraft/saves (Windows key + R, type "%appdata%, press enter, and locate to the saves folder.).
3. Extract the .zip you downloaded
4. Move the new folder into the saves folder
5. Launch Minecraft and find the world in your Singleplayer menu.
